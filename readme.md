### Notes

I did some minor improvements like adding a API key and one unit test,
the "admin" token and the employee token can both be used to access
the rest api, but the "admin" token have more control.

If this was a proper project I would have added
- SQL database for the admin tokens with encryption and hash+salt
- SQL databases for employee data with extra protection
- Added more unit tests and more complex testing
- Nginx cache as front end for this API
- A more intuitive way to interact with the API if needed
- Certificate for the API with HTTPS

### How to use this spring-boot project

- Install packages with `mvn package`
- Run `mvn spring-boot:run` for starting the application (or use your IDE)

Application (with the embedded H2 database) is ready to be used ! You can access the url below for testing it :

- Swagger UI : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- H2 UI : http://localhost:8080/h2-console

> Don't forget to set the `JDBC URL` value as `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` for H2 UI.
